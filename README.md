# Cake.Npm.Module

Cake.Npm.Module is a Module for Cake, which extends it with a new `IPackageInstaller` for installing tools using the Node.js package manager (`npm`).

npm is the package manager for JavaScript and the default for Node.js. Npm consists of both the `npm` client and the npm registry available at `npmjs.org`. This module supports basic package installation including specific versions, tags, install behaviour and custom registries.
